## About Me

Yo guys! ðŸ‘‹

I'm Shivam Sharma, an undergraduate student at IIT Madras. I'm a web developer, Android and iOS app developer, and I'm enthusiastic about AI and ML.

My goal? Well, I'm on a mission to master some technical skills like web development, ML, AI, app development, and even some gnarly reinforcement learning.
